class: middle
# What is concurrency?
 - Evaluating tasks "at the same time"
 - Performing tasks independently of each other
---
class: middle
# Concurrency is challenging

 - Non-determinism.
 - Complex error handling.
 - More elements processed than expected.

# Cancelation
 - In-progress side effects are canceled.
 - A canceled `IO` may not fully complete.
 - Code should be designed to be cancelation safe.
 - `ExitCase.Canceled` observed in `onFinalizeCase`.

# Key takeaways
 - `Ref` is used to store shared state.
 - `SignallingRef` is used to stream state changes.
 - `discrete` constructs a blocking stream
 - `continuous` is non-blocking
