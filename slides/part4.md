# Is this familiar?

???

Ask for examples of load.

# Examples
 - Button mashing in a game.
 - Spikes in traffic to a webserver.
 - Video streaming in a browser.

 - 00:20 ‚Äî Ethel and Lucy can easily wrap the candy on time.
 - 00:26 - Ethel doesn't have enough to do.
 - 00:36 - Ethel loses the first candy. She prepares an area on the table to store unwrapped candy.
 - 00:44 - Ethel realizes that she will not be able to wrap the stored candy. She purposefully eats one.
 - 00:44 - Ethel and Lucy place the stored candy in their hats. 
 - 01:41 - The supervisor checks on the process. She doesn't see the stored candy and concludes that the candy is being wrapped well.
 - 01:45 - In response, the candy production rate is sped up.

# Bad design
 - Lucy doesn't control the rate of work.
 - Lucy has no pre-defined overflow strategy.
 - The supervisor has poor visiblity.

---
class: middle
# Good design

 - Well-defined response to load.
 - Buffer strategy.
 - Predictable behaviour on error.

# Push systems
 - Elements are "pushed" from a producer to a consumer.
 - Elements may be buffered.
 - Require backpressure.
   - Consumer communicates rate to the producer.
   
# Examples
 - Job switching
 - TCP
 - Browser Websocket API

---
class: middle

# Pull systems
- No concept of consumer and producer.
- Similar to function call and return.
- Elements are pulled by the caller.
- The callee may block.
- Pulling is not polling.

# Examples
 - fs2

# Why are pull systems better?

---
class: middle

# Pull system advantages

 - Easy to reason about
 - No backpressure required
 - Well-defined error handling
 - Well-defined termination

---
class: middle

# A problem
 - Pull systems are easy to reason about.
 - Real world systems are push.
 - Interfacing between push and pull is needed.
